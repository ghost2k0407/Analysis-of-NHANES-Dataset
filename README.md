# **NHANES Data Analysis**

## **1. Understanding the Dataset**
The dataset consists of **biometric measurements** of **adult males and females** from the **NHANES 2020 survey**. The goal is to analyze patterns in body measurements and identify insights related to body composition.

### **Dataset Structure**
- **BMXWT**: Weight (kg)
- **BMXHT**: Height (cm)
- **BMXARML**: Arm length (cm)
- **BMXLEG**: Leg length (cm)
- **BMXARMC**: Arm circumference (cm)
- **BMXHIP**: Hip circumference (cm)
- **BMXWAIST**: Waist circumference (cm)

## **2. Data Preprocessing**
To prepare the dataset for analysis, the following steps are taken:

### **A. Handling Missing Values**
- Check for missing or `NaN` values in biometric measurements.
- **Strategy:** Impute missing values using the **mean/median** or remove rows if necessary.

### **B. Data Cleaning**
- Ensure all measurements are in **consistent units**.
- Check for duplicate entries and remove if found.

## **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
### **A. Summary Statistics**
- Calculate **mean, median, standard deviation** for each biometric variable.

### **B. Distribution Analysis**
- **Histograms**: Show how body measurements are distributed.
- **Boxplots**: Identify variations and potential outliers.

### **C. Correlation Analysis**
- **Heatmap (Seaborn)**: Identify relationships between body measurements.
- Example insights:
  - **Height vs. Weight** correlation analysis.
  - **Waist-to-Hip ratio** comparison across genders.

## **4. Feature Engineering**
- Calculate **Body Mass Index (BMI)** using `BMI = Weight / (Height in meters)^2`
- Analyze the distribution of BMI among male and female participants.

---

## **5. Statistical Analysis**
- **Skewness & Kurtosis**: Assess normality of the data.
- **T-tests/ANOVA**: Compare body measurements between males and females.
- **Regression Analysis**: Predict weight based on height and other biometric features.

---

## **6. Insights & Public Health Impact**
- **What biometric differences exist between males and females?**
  - Differences in average height, weight, waist circumference, etc.
- **Are there significant correlations in body measurements?**
  - Identifying proportionality in body structure.
- **How does BMI vary across different body types?**
  - Understanding obesity trends based on body measurements.

---

## **7. Next Steps**
- Extend analysis to **different age groups** in NHANES.
- Compare results with **previous years' NHANES data**.
- Use machine learning models to **predict BMI categories**.
